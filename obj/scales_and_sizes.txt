base:
	(creech airforce base as example)
	important things will have inner fences with guard shack on one side with (vehicle gate/or rolly fence),
		also would have a path for people (just an opening)
	invisioned as tent city, temporary plywood structures, rebuild some runways
	military range close (staging, fly out of, near a test range, in an area nobody wants, not a lot of people live, close to main base for logistics)
	from the 50's to now, there would be an entryway added to the hangar to badge people in, possibly metal detectors, (more sophisticated entry procedure)

		built base to support that which would have hangars and an air strip
			(while building base they found cave system)
		that's what caused them to build up the underground laboratory around that
	was already a town around, built up infrastructure around town
	
	other buildings
	- dormatories for people who don't live off base
	- dining hall
	- gym

nothing should be underground that doesn't need to be

town started springing up around it,	
	old military housing close
	dorms on base
	chow hall

while building underground base, find cave
open up into the cave system, all of the workers die in 30 minutes
